## Lage Berger Jensen

The original author of this project is Lage Berger Jensen. All of this was made possible by the effort Lage Berger Jensen put into getting this project off the ground and the many hours that were spent making everything work.

This project was generated using a [Plaster template](https://github.com/lagebj/PlasterTemplates) that he put together and shared with the community. It is modeled after the way he builds his projects. A lot of the base structure for this project was put in place by that Plaster template. [lagebj.github.io](http://lagebj.github.io)
